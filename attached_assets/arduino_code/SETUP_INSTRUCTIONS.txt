ðŸ”§ Arduino Camera Setup for ThirdEye
=====================================

ðŸ“‹ STEPS TO CONFIGURE YOUR ARDUINO:

1. Open the file: CameraUploadsPicture.ino

2. Replace this line (line 12):
   const char *uploadUrl = "https://YOUR-REPLIT-URL.replit.dev/upload-arduino-image";
   
   WITH your actual Replit URL:
   const char *uploadUrl = "https://workspace-hupatel1052000.replit.dev/upload-arduino-image";

3. Update WiFi credentials if needed (lines 10-11):
   const char *ssid_Router = "OnePlus10pro";
   const char *password_Router = "Th!rdEye$#";

4. Upload the code to your Arduino ESP32

5. Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to see status messages

ðŸ“¡ HOW IT WORKS:

âœ… Arduino connects to WiFi
âœ… Captures image every 3 seconds
âœ… POSTs image directly to ThirdEye server
âœ… No ngrok needed!
âœ… Arduino and ThirdEye can be on different networks

ðŸŽ¯ TO USE:

1. Power on Arduino (it will start uploading images automatically)
2. Open ThirdEye in your browser
3. Select "Arduino Camera" from the camera source toggle
4. Click "Start"
5. ThirdEye will use the latest uploaded image from Arduino!

âœ¨ The Arduino continuously uploads images, so ThirdEye always has fresh images to analyze.
